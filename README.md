👋 Hi there, I’m **@securechell**.
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, crime documentaries, reading, and most recently lockpicking!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a whole lot of cyber stuff. Right now I'm doing TryHackMe's Advent of Cyber.
- 🔗 I’m looking to connect and collaborate on anything related to cybersecurity! Especially the Incident Response side of things.
- 📫 You can reach me via [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cheryll-o/).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm from a completely non-cyber background. Think medical sciences, human sciences, healthcare...yep, nowhere near cyber!

✨ *Here are a few things I can't do without, that I would easily recommend:* ✨
- 🎮 [**My Steam Deck**](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck/): handheld gaming computer I love to decompress with. I'm currently addicted to playing *Dead Cells* after previously being addicted to *Mark of the Ninja*.

- 🎧 **Podcasts**: mainly true crime (my faves are [Swindled](https://swindledpodcast.com/), [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/), and [RedHanded](https://redhandedpodcast.com/)), with [My Therapist Ghosted Me](https://www.mytherapistghostedme.com/) thrown in to lighten things up a bit!

- 👂 [**Loop Earplugs**](https://www.loopearplugs.com/?country=GB): amazing noise-reduction earplugs, perfect for sleep, study/focused work, and travel. If I'm not listening to a podcast, chances are I'll have these in my ears.

- 📖 [**Kobo eReader**](https://uk.kobobooks.com/): perfect for reading anytime, anywhere. For optimum use, I combine it with Loop earplugs!
  
- 🟣 [**Obsidian**](https://obsidian.md/): a note-taking app. It's what I use to create and organise my notes.

- 🔥 [**Backblaze**](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup/personal): secure online backup service. I've used it to back up my entire computer. There's no way I'm losing all these notes I've made!

- 🕊️ [**Flown**](https://flown.com/how-it-works): a virtual co-working platform and a godsend! It gives me [body-doubling](https://www.understood.org/en/articles/body-doubling-for-adhd-what-it-is-and-how-it-works), provides me with structure and accountability, makes me more productive, and even helps me declutter.

- 💸 [**YNAB (You Need A Budget)**](https://www.ynab.com/): a money management app. Because these days I'm trying (trying) to manage my finances.

- 👾 [**ChatGPT**](https://chatgpt.com/) / [**Perplexity**](https://www.perplexity.ai/): AI platforms. I'm not an all-knowing cyborg yet, so these tools act as an assistant and help me with: quick info lookup (e.g., definitions, explanations, etc), drafting outlines for projects, summarising long pieces of text, and more...
